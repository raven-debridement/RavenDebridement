To Do List
----------

- video two continuous iterations of debridement (Greg)

- improve foam segmentation
  - idea: instead of individually segmenting
    both images, finding the centroids, and
    computing the 3d point, use a matching/correspondence
    function (opencv has this functions for this)

- create transform from camera frame to base frame
  using chessboards (Anna)

- identify the gripper pose NOT using AR markers (Jonathan)

- use the wrist AR marker to confirm gripper pose estimate
